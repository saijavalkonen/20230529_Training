# Troublshooting Web Server problems

There are several things to try if your Web Server is not functioning properly.

-   If others cannot connect to your server, try turning off their firewalls.

-   If your server is running slowly, try limiting it to 2 or 3 connections.

-   If your server keeps creating pop-up ads when people access it, please turn them off and things will run faster.

-   If these directions are not helpful, please contact your service representative.
