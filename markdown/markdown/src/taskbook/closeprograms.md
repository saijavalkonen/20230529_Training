# Close all of your programs

You need to shut down everything else before installing major programs

1.  If you are on a Windows system, click the X in the corner of each program.

2.  If you are on a Linux system, type kill -9 \[PID\] for each of your programs.

    You might want to save your data first.

3.  If you are on a Macintosh, you will have to ask someone else. I have a wonderful little iPod, but that is the limit of my experience with Apple products.
