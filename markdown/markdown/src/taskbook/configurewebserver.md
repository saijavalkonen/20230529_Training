# Configuring your Web Server

Configuring your Web Server can be as complex or as simple as you want it to be.

**Note:** In this instance, the technical writer knows nothing about his subject.

1.  Turn on the web server

2.  Go to the Options menu

3.  Follow that to "Web Server Preferences"

4.  Make sure all of the right buttons are checked, or else you will never get it to work

5.  Go to your site library and check out a book; any book, even about COBOL, is likely to be more helpful than I am.
