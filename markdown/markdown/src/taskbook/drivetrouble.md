# Troubleshooting your hard disk

Follow these steps to try and fix any problems with your hard drive.

-   Run scandisk on the drive. This may solve all of your problems.

-   Try defragmenting the drive. This could help with retrieval times.

-   If the drive is still slow, try deleting old or useless information.

-   If the drive cannot access anything, there are some expensive tools at Best Buy that my help you save some of your information. But, you're probably out of luck.

-   If the drive makes funny clicking noises, back everything up as soon as possible.

    You probably have some important data stored in bad sectors. This is going to be painful to fix. Make sure you have a copy of your Operating System CDs.

-   If all else fails, you can always try calling technical support. However, this can be very expensive, unless you call within 13 hours of your purchase.
