# Troubleshooting a database

Databases rarely have problems, but this may be helpful if you find some.

-   If performance is slow, try removing several thousand records.

-   If none of your commands work, make sure they are SQL commands and not SEQUEL commands.

-   If you cannot get anything to work at all, try uninstalling and reinstalling.

-   For more detailed troubleshooting help, see the online documentation shipped with your database.
