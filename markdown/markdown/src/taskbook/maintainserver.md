# Maintaining a Web Server

Maintaining a web server is really quite easy.

-   If the web server crashes, restart it.

-   Limit the number of connections to your server.

    This will make it run faster.

-   Make sure you do not put confidential material on your server.

    It should be kept in a separate folder named "Private."
