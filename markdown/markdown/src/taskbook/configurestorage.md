# Configuring hard storage devices

Most hard disks do not require any configuring. If they do, the instructions are relatively simple.

First check the documentation that came with your storage device. If the device requires configuring, follow the steps below.

1.  If your system recognizes the device, it may be able to configure it without help. If so, do not try and stop it.

2.  Otherwise, your drive should come with software. Use this software to format and partition your drive.

3.  Once your drive is configured, restart the system. Just for fun. But be sure to remove any vendor software from your system before doing so.
